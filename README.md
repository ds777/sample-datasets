## simData

  From Magrini, S. (2007). [Analysing convergence through the distribution dynamics approach: why and how?](https://sites.google.com/a/unive.it/smagrini/home/matlab-code)

- The first series was obtained by drawing a random sample of 1000 observations from a univariate normal distribution
- The second series was instead produced by merging and appropriately sorting two random samples of 500 observations
  - These two samples, again drawn from a univariate normal distribution, differed in their means
